## Quinn Michaels

![Quinn Michaels](https://deva.space/cdn/people/quinn.jpg) Quinn Michaels is the name of the dude behind all the stuff here.  That's me... I'm writing all the text, but sometimes have to pretend someone else is writing it for me, so that way you can put yourself in the picture.

When really it's just me, Quinn, sitting at a computer typing away with my **speedy fingers**.

#### Writing Code  
**My coding history:** Piles of Javascript, dabble of Vue.js, pipe loads of MongoDB, truck loads of HTML, tons of Stylus(CSS), piled on NodeJs, loving Markdown, dealing JSON, some Shell Scripts, ugh Ruby, oooh Python, kinda remember Objective C, tinybit of Java, throw in some PHP, add lots and lots of ColdFusion, and way too much SQL

#### Watching Anime  
I have a yearly subscription to **Crunchyroll** for all the anime I can handle in my brain knuckles when I'm not writing code or practicing my own Cartooning.  Anime is pretty awesome in many ways, and if you asked me what was on Netflix I couldn't tell you.  If you wanna talk **Crunchroll** that's a whole different story.

#### Singing Bowls  
I have a pretty nice collection of Tibetan Singing Bowls that I have been collecting over the last few years, and really I find they are one of the most enjoyable parts of my day in combination with meditation.

#### Meditating
As much and as often as possible.  A healthy meditative state is great food for a hungry imagination... that's what I say anyway.

#### Research
Researching stuff is entertaining to learn new things and discover what other smart people are building around the world. Being a programmer it requires constant research into new developments, methods, ideas, and technologies that are constantly rolling out into the world of technology.

#### Practicing Buddhism
I consider my Buddhist Practice a type of hobby as it's something I spend a great deal of time on in my life.  Learning about all the things in, around, and about Buddhism to me is very exciting, and proven to be a good use of my time.

I think that's pretty much it for now.  If I think of something else I will add it to this spot here.

Thanks,  
Quinn
