# INDRA VUEJS GUI BOILERPLATE
This is the GUI (Graphical User Interface) boilerplate toolkit for building out Indra interfaces for use in various projects.

The gui boilerplate is built on standard Open Source components like NodeJs, Webpack, VueJs, and Stylus Preprocessor (CSS).

## Clone Repository
Then clone the repository to your dev machine to start using it on your projects.

## Install

```

## Running the server
The server runs in two modes.  Development and Production.

### Development Server

### Production Builds
To create a production build and package all the files into the `./build` directory for deployment run this command.
